Read notes, reviewed video's 

4.18.14
copied files over to hw6 folder
read thru headers and assignment 

4.19.14
implemented repair heap and build heap
ran generic tests and compared to area51
found both tests for my version alt:: and fsu:: have the same computer count
need to make some changes to get better implementation

4.20.14
found I had heap repair implemented wrong
did not have loc
messed around with heap sort
inserted in build in replace of the of push for loop
made changes to pop, inserted in repair to take place, shorted that function
put it all together.
comp count for fsu:: is now less than alt and mataches the area51
testing bitwise operators, yeilds slightly less counts

double checked outputs
