read over notes..geez. This looks fun.


4.8.14(2hrs)
read more of notes 
completed all of the files to be copied over
created area51Test dir to keep testing seperate

4.10.14(3.5hrs)
started with insert
concept of insert seems solid
having trouble getting it ordered correctly, my two ifs work 
found popfront was not the way to go, need to update data member directly
cuts down on run time also, good move


4.11.14(4hrs)
++ operator started
proves to be more difficult than insert
pointers can get confusing with that many being manipulated
having trouble getting past first on T test for fhblt.x

4.12.14(2hrs)
finsihed ++ operator.
tested on multiple insert/Traversals
satisfied
Starting on sparse matrix times sparse vector multiplication

4.13.14(5hrs)
loop was taken off of startutil...thanks Lacher, that would have been mind
numbing for a minute
once loop acuired having access data to perform multiplication
AHHHHHHH....Retrieve returns the value...thats what u and v are in the damn
notes!!!!
finished
